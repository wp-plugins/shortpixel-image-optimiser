== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Should I pick lossy or lossless optimisation? =

This depends on your compression needs. Lossy has a better compression rate than lossless compression. The resulting image is not 100% identical with the original. Works well for photos taken with your camera.

With lossless compression, the shrunk image will be identical with the original and smaller in size. Use this when you do not want to loose any of the original image's details. Works best for technical drawings, clip art and comics.

For more information about the difference read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression#Lossy_and_lossless_compression"Wiki article</a>.

= Why do I need an API key? =

ShortPixel uses automated processes to crunch images. The API integrates in the WordPress dashboard of your website and processes both old and new images automatically.
You can also use the API in your own applications, the <a href="https://shortpixel.com/api-docs">Documentation API</a> shows you how.

= Where do I get my API key? =

To get your API key, you must <a href="https://shortpixel.com/free-sign-up">Sign up to ShortPixel</a>. You will receive your personal API key in a confirmation email to the address you provided. Use your API key to activate ShortPixel plugin in the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

= Where do I use my API key? =

You use the API key in the ShortPixel plugin Settings, don’t forget to click Save Settings. The same API can be used on multiple websites/blogs. 

= What does bulk optimisation mean? =

The bulk option lets ShortPixel optimise all your images at once (not one by one). You can do this in the Media > Bulk ShortPixel section by clicking on the Compress all your images button.

= Are my images safe? =

Yes, privacy is guaranteed. The ShortPixel automated encryption process doesn't allow anyone to view your photos.

= What types of formats can be optimised? =

For now, ShortPixel supports JPEG and PNG. Thumbnails are also optimised. Additional formats are scheduled for optimisation in the future.
