== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Should I pick lossy or losssless optimisation =

This depends on your compression needs. Lossy has a better compression rate than lossless compression. 
The resulting image is not 100% identical with the original. Works well for photos taken with your camera.

With lossless compression, the shrunk image will be identical with the original and smaller in size. 
Use this when you do not want to loose any of the original image's details. Works best for technical drawings, clip art and comics.


= Is my privacy ensured, are all my images safe? =

Yes, privacy is guaranteed. The ShortPixel automated encription process doesn't allow anyone to view your photos.
